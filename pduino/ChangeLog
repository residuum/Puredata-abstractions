	  boards like the Teensy

2010-02-09 14:34  eighthave

	* arduino.pd: - made [pinMode INPUT( also send [digitalIns( so that
	  you only need to switch
	  a pin to INPUT mode in order to get data
	  
	  - removed some extraneous dollarg message boxes that were left
	  from converting
	  the messages from byte streams to lists of bytes.

2010-02-09 14:00  eighthave

	* arduino.pd: converted all output messages except digital to lists
	  instead of bytes so that they get bundled better into USB packets

	* arduino-help.pd, arduino-test.pd, arduino.pd: - added a "port"
	  message for sending a complete port at a time, directly
	  reflecting the underlying digital message and the fact that
	  digital outputs
	  on a microcrontroller are handled on an 8-bit port basis.

2008-11-25 00:07  eighthave

	* arduino.pd: Fixed bug reported by Derek Holzer here:
	  http://lists.puredata.info/pipermail/pd-list/2008-10/065393.html
	  
	  Basically, it needs to keep track of the state of all of the pins
	  on the
	  arduino, it was only keeping track per-port, and then using the
	  state of one
	  port when outputting another.

2008-09-08 22:59  eighthave

	* arduino-test.pd: implemented GUI reset, so that whenever you
	  reopen the device, all of the GUIs get reset to their initial
	  state to match the arduino's state

	  be. Right now, it is just info directly from [comport].

2008-09-08 21:16  eighthave

	* arduino-test.pd: set pinMode toggles to 1 since StandardFirmata
	  defaults to OUTPUT mode on digital pins; a couple minor cleanups
	  as well

2008-08-30 16:10  eighthave

	* arduino.pd: removed some debug float boxes

	  digital inputs and the toggling ofdigital port
	  reporting working

2008-04-11 22:08  eighthave

	* arduino-test.pd, arduino.pd: First stab at implementing v2 of the
	  protocol, digitalWrite works, but no luck
	  yet with digital input. I am not sure if the problem is in Pd or
	  Firmata.

2008-04-09 22:55  eighthave

	  sysex, sysex isn't fully tested.

2008-03-17 03:42  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware: Removed original Firmata Arduino firmware, since it
	  is now part of the Arduino
	  SVN:
	  
	  http://svn.berlios.de/svnroot/repos/arduino/trunk/hardware/firmwares/Firmata/

2007-09-24 23:46  eighthave

	  version

2007-04-13 03:55  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Makefile, Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde: sketched out
	  EEPROM library support, but it doesn't work yet ; renamed some
	  variables for clarity ; made digital pins set to OUTPUT by
	  default so that you don't get lots of random data, unless you
	  want it ;)

2007-03-08 06:23  eighthave

	* README: last minute comments

2007-03-08 05:37  eighthave

	  arduino.pd: cleaned up for the Pduino 0.3 release

2007-03-06 06:59  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-test.pd, arduino.pd: - got
	  digital inputs working reading by port, sends only on change
	  - ignore Rx/Tx pins (0 and 1) since they are used for serial/USB
	  - removed a fair amount of cruft

2007-03-05 17:08  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-test.pd, arduino.pd: -
	  Removed lots of cruft and various attempts at fixing things.
	  
	  - Removed timer2 interrupt code because it was interfering with
	  the hardware
	  PWM on some pins. Replaced it with timer0_overflow_count from
	  wiring.c but
	  that's not fully functional yet, I think I have to get the time
	  units
	  right. Right now it seems to just output everytime rather than
	  every 4ms
	  
	  - removed second [arduino] object in arduino-test.pd that was
	  causing lost
	  serial data.
	  
	  WORKING
	  - analog input working
	  - hardware PWM output working
	  - digital output working
	  - setPinMode to INPUT/OUTPUT for digital pins working
	  
	  NOT WORKING YET

	* Pd_firmware/Makefile, Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde,
	  Pd_firmware/press.wav, arduino.pd: analog input is kind of
	  working; pinMode is working; digital output is working; things
	  are timer driven now

2007-02-28 04:10  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Makefile, Pd_firmware/press.wav: added voice prompt
	  to press the reset button so that avrdude can upload the new
	  firmware

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-test.pd, arduino.pd: - got
	  analog input working
	  - version reporting works, but checkInput() isn't run enough, so
	  it misses the
	  data if there is a lot of traffic on the serial port

2007-02-20 06:25  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde: stripped down to nothing and started
	  to rebuild from scratch; got digital output working

2006-09-15 05:22  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-help.pd, arduino-test.pd,
	  arduino.pd: redesigned the input protocol to be a 3-byte
	  sequence, the first byte is the
	  data type, the second two are the data. The second two bytes are
	  then
	  combined to give one 14-bit value.
	  
	  For example 240 0 1 (from serial) == [version 1( (Pd message)
	  
	  arduino-test.pd was updated for this, the help patch was not, but
	  should be
	  largely correct. I only tightened up the layout of the help
	  patch.

2006-09-04 15:43  grholzi

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde: some fixes in the firmware for PWM

2006-09-04 15:42  grholzi

	* arduino-help.pd, arduino.pd: better helpfile and some fixes

2006-09-04 07:44  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-test.pd: switched to default

	  expanded [arduino] object and cleaned up the help patch;
	  commented Arduino code and enabled digitalInput, tho it doesn't
	  seem to work yet; it seems that there are bugs in [comport] since
	  I can make it crash with the stress test with the new OVERLAPPED
	  mode, and the older synchronous mode

2006-05-21 17:37  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-help.pd, arduino.pd: its now
	  possible to turn on and off digital and analog input, so you can
	  stop arduino from sending data alltoger, while still responding;
	  digitalInputs are still not tested

2006-05-20 16:26  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-help.pd, arduino.pd: looks
	  like analog input is working fine, next, the digital inputs need
	  to be tested.

2006-05-20 15:50  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-help.pd: all outputs seem to
	  be working, now its time to test all of the inputs; cleaned up
	  some cruft too

2006-05-20 15:29  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-help.pd, arduino.pd: its
	  messy, but digital output and PWM now work at the same time

2006-05-20 10:18  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino-help.pd, arduino.pd: got PWM
	  control working from Pd

2006-05-19 12:54  eighthave

	* Pd_firmware/Pd_firmware.pde, arduino.pd: worked out 2-way

	  examples/PD_two_potentiometers.pd: rewrote PD_inputs_to_PD.pd
	  using PD_two_potentiometers as a starting place, but made
	  improvements on the algorithm; added GPL statement to all

2006-03-05 06:48  eighthave

	* examples/PD_all_inputs.pd, examples/PD_inputs_to_PD.pd,
	  examples/PD_send_potentiometer.pd,
	  examples/PD_two_potentiometers.pd, examples/Pd_Input,
	  examples/Pd_Input/Pd_Input.pde: some example patches for the
	  existing puredata firmwares, and the start of firmware for
	  getting all inputs into Pd as fast as possible. Some clean-up
	  needed before a real release

2006-03-04 22:21  eighthave

	* ., examples, examples/PD_inputs_to_PD.pd,
	  examples/PD_send_potentiometer.pd: PD_send_potentiometer.pd now
	  works with the arduino firmware of the same name;
	  PD_inputs_to_PD.pd still needs some work
